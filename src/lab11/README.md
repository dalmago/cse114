Write a method  that sums  all the numbers in the major diagonal in an n x n 
matrix of double  values  using the following header:

public static  double  sumMajorDiagonal(double [][] m)

Write a test program  that first prompts the user to enter the dimension n of 
an n x n matrix, then asks them to enter the matrix row by row (with the 
elements  separated by spaces). The program  should then print out the sum  
of the major diagonal of the matrix.
