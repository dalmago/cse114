1. Write a Java program in the Eclipse IDE that reads a Celsius degree in 
double from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the 
result. The formula for the conversion is as follows: 

fahrenheit = (9.0/5) * celsius + 32

Hint: 9.0/5 is 1.8 in Java as opposed to 9/5, which is 1.

Here is a sample run: 

Enter a degree in Celsius: “43” (Enter)

43 in Celsius is 109.4 in Fahrenheit
