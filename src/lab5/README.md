1. (Checking a number) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an 
integer and checks whether it is divisible by both 5 and 6, or neither of 
them, or just one of them.

2. (Finding the number of days in a month) Write a program that prompts the 
user to enter the month and year, and displays the number of days in the 
month. For example, if the user entered month 2 and year 2000, the program 
should display that February 2000 has 29 days. If the user entered month 3 
and year 2005, the program should display that March 2005 has 31 days.

3. 6.24 (Perfect Numbers) An integer  number is said to be a perfect number 
if its factors, including 1 (but not the number itself), sum  to the number. 
For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Write a method  
isPerfect that determines whether  parameter  number is a perfect number. Use
this method  in an application that displays all the perfect numbers between  
1 and and integer  entered by the user. Display the factors of each perfect 
number to confirm that the number is indeed perfect. Challenge the computing 
power of your computer by testing numbers much larger  than 1000. Display the 
results.
