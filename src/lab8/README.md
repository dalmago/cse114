Lab 8
=====

Write a static  method , getBigWords, that gets a single String  parameter  
and returns an array  whose elements  are the words in the parameter  that 
contain more than 5 letters. (A word is defined as a contiguous sequence of 
letters.) 

EXAMPLE: So, if the String  argument  passed to the method  was “There are 
87,000,000 people in Canada”, getBigWords would return an array  of two 
elements , “people” and “Canada”. 

ANOTHER EXAMPLE: If the String  argument  passed to the method  was “Send the 
request to support@turingscraft.com”, getBigWords would return an array  of 
three elements , “request”, “support” and “turingscraft”.
